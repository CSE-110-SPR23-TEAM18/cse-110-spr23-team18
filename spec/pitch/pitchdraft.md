# Apollo 18 Pitch: Timeless Tweets #

## Statement of Purpose ##

The purpose of our project is to provide an entertainment platform that imitates the art of fortune telling. Our interface will mimic the social media platform Twitter’s wireframe, which will allow the user to “tweet” a question regarding their future and their future self will respond having already “known” what the future holds. The reason we chose to use Twitter as the mode of delivering a fortune was because it is a platform that encourages public conversations. Overall, the goal of this project is to create an app that provides its users with a fun way to explore their curiosity about what the future holds while also showcasing how technology can simulate fortune telling. We aim to offer a unique and entertaining experience for users of our platform. 

## User Personas ##

For Gen Z Users: 11 to 26 years old
(groups might be more likely looking forward to their prospective future)
To target Gen Z users, you can use a playful and casual tone. Start by asking questions about their future self, such as "What do you see yourself doing in 5 years?" or "What kind of person do you hope to be in the future?" Then, reply to your own question as if you were their future self, offering advice or insights based on your own experience.

For Millennial Users: 27 to 42 years old 
(groups might be more likely looking into their past)
To target millennial users, you can use a more reflective and introspective tone. Ask questions that prompt them to reflect on their past, such as "What advice would you give your younger self?" or "What have been the biggest lessons you've learned so far in life?" Then, reply to your own question as if you were their past self, offering wisdom and guidance based on your own experience.

For Baby Boomer Users: 59 to 77 years old
To target baby boomer users, you can use a more authoritative and informative tone. Ask questions that relate to their life experience, such as "What was the most challenging time in your career?" or "What were your biggest accomplishments in life?" Then, reply to your own question as if you were an expert or mentor, offering insights and advice based on your own knowledge and experience.

## Risks and Rabbitholes ##

### Risks of Input + Output Specificity

- Careful on how specific replies are (how closely related to the topic in the question/statement)
- Decipherability of the input (question/statement, type of question)
- Rabbit Hole: overthinking distance in the future of the reply (1 day vs. 1 year)
- Ethical boundaries of the input (screening of the input)
- Ethical boundaries of the replies are safe, not too negative (Twitter is known to be harsh)
- Boundary: limiting replies to just text currently 
- Handling question/statement deciphering if libraries go down
- Ignore character limit (bounded to library limit)

### Risk of Visual Specificity ###

- Rabbit holes: Focusing too much on Twitter number similarity (amount of replies, relation between view count to retweet count to like count)
- Boundary: Make sure the color and typography to be similar to twitter, and should implement the visual specificity after having a confirmed color palette and typography palette
- Boundary part 2: Decide on Dark Mode or Light Mode, not both
- Make username input requirement obvious
- Rabbit Hole: How the output is printed, such as line by line, all at once, character by character (possible future issue)

### Overextensions / If We had More Time ###
- Menu to allow users to use other social media platform UI’s (Reddit, Instagram, WeChat, etc.)
- Use Popular Twitter users reply as predictors to generate  output
- Adding voice features for outputs to increase engagement and accessibility
- Combine voice with popular twitter users
- Alter reply based on how far in the future
- Allow for multiple replies (multiple future selves, multiple popular twitter users)
- Adding on using AI, do  want to develop an algorithm that can better provide meaningful and relevant response facilitating
