### 8-Ball Development

-   Had our work looked over by Akshay -- looks pretty good so far
-   Need to style so that it looks better
-   Changing the design with CSS so that it looks like a rocket ship and a moon, in line with our theme
-   We have audio (plays text-to-speech audio when an answer is generated)
-   Added a background image to the app of space
-   No animation, but it will have a space theme now and not just be a boring text box where you can ask a question

### Slides

-   Work on the slides so that we have the deliverables ready by tomorrow noon

The meeting ended at 8:00pm
