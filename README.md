## Projects

### 8-Ball Project

Towards the beginning of the quarter, we made an introductory project on an 8-ball that was generated using various generative AIs and large language models. Here's a link to the [project](https://cse110-sp23-group18.github.io/cse110-sp23-group18/8ballapp/eightball.html).

Tasseography, or tea leaf reading, is the final project of the quarter. This is a fortune-telling application we are building that will give various readings to users. A link to our project can be found [here](https://apollo18-tealeaves.netlify.app).

For development and contributions to this project, docs can be found [here](/docs/devdocs.md).
