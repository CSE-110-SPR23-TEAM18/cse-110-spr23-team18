### Primary Means of Communication and Expectations 

The main form of communication will be via Slack. Members should check for notifications on the team Slack channel. All members will be expected to read messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 12 hours.

<br>



  
### Scheduling Meetings 
Weekly meetings are to be tentatively held on Tuesdays from 6:30-7:30pm after class. Fridays from 4-5pm will be an additional meeting time as needed. If someone cannot make it to the meeting, they are expected to communicate that before the meeting.


<br>




### General Responsibilities for All Team Members  
- Be punctual, be present. Show up to meetings on time, and participate.   
- Be responsible and accountable for assigned tasks, meeting deadlines.   
- Communicate with other team members if there are any unexpected circumstances that prevent one from meeting their responsibilities. Respond to messages in a timely manner.   
- Be supportive of one another. Respect each other’s opinions, ideas, and contributions.

### Conflict Resolution

If conflict may arise, contact your team leaders. If it cannot be resolved, we will contact the assigned TA. As a last resort, the professor will be involved. It is highly encouraged to try and resolve issues through communication before contacting leaders, TAs, etc.

<br>

### Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s
- We expect faculty to be available during work hours to help guide our group with any questions that we may have. We hope that faculty will be patient, as many of our group members may not have previous experience with working in a software development environment.
- If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
