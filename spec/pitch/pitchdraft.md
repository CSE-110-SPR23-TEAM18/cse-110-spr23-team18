# Apollo 18 Pitch: r/FindMyFutureJob #

## Statement of Purpose ##

The purpose of our project is to create an interactive application that emulates the art of tea leaf reading. Tea leaf reading, also known as tasseography, has been practiced for centuries as a way to gain insight into the future. However, not everyone has access to an expert tea leaf reader, and many people are interested in exploring this ancient practice on their own. Therefore our application provides an accessible and user-friendly platform for individuals to conduct their own tea leaf readings. Users can choose from a variety of tea blends, and the application will generate a unique pattern based on the way the leaves settle in the cup.

## Risks and Rabbitholes ##

### Input Difficulties ###

- making sure the user knows what to click/know what was clicked
- making sure it is clear what is being chosen (everything needs to be labeled)
- make sure users can change their choices of tea type before they do the “pouring” action
  - button to confirm


### Output Difficulties ###

- Making sure the output is visible in the background, the user knows where it is
- making sure the tea leaves users end up seeing is shown alongside the text animation being compatible across devices
- the fortune outputted may not be specific enough for the user’s liking
- transition between frames (different perspectives)  is not smooth
- answers should apply to anything anyone would want to know in their future
- answers should not involve violence, and are ethical 


### Overextensions / If We had More Time ###
- Menu to allow users to use other social media platform UI’s (Twitter, Instagram, WeChat, etc.)
- Include other strong descriptions of a future after undergrad (grad school, law school, etc.)
- Add old reddit UI
- Adding voice features for outputs to increase engagement and accessibility
- Alter reply based on how far in the future after college
- Allow for multiple job possibilities (multiple future selves)
- Rabbit Hole: Integrating other platforms with the app may raise issues. ex: possible compatibility issues when integrating the app with web browser on computers vs. phones
- Adding on using AI, do  want to develop an algorithm that can better provide meaningful and relevant response facilitating
- Describing how successful the person will be at their job
- Account for much younger/older students (high schoolers, students starting college when older)
