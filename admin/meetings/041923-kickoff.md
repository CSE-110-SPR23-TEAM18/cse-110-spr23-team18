## Minutes

### Deciding Branding / Group Names

-   Brian went to go grab markers for the poster
-   Decided on Team 18: Apollo 18
    -   Space theme
    -   Was an film about an Apollo mission that got abandoned
    -   Premise: it was a movie about a space mission where they left to the moon and never returned
    -   Easier to brand because it's just a space theme
    -

### The Poster

-   Was going to go off of the Team 18+: NSFW idea
-   Poster needs to be split into Team Number, Name/Branding/Logo, and Yes/No (both sides, one side with Yes, the other with No)
    -   Kavi works on the poster during the meeting
    -   Shuyi takes from Kavi for handwriting
    -   Grant took on the drawing of our logo, brand and the rest of the drawings for the poster
-   Will go with the Apollo 18 idea
-   Logo is Moon with rocket soaring away.

### Contract

-   Made a google docs [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KniuXz4GH5TEwPsB-WSj5CyazKCOxrX07pw1sZKRgTE/edit) for now, will transcribe into markdown later
-   Fangyu added in the template for the team agreement

### Team Page

-   Brian is setting up the org github repo
-   Fangyu: has anyone used wikis before (for documentation and team page)
